# Colorizer
**Over4view**

This app is part of the Treehouse course on making menu for apps. In this app the main focus is developing menu not on the app
itself.

The app is basically like a editing photo. It serves as photo viewer with ability to switch between available photos. Then also
filter the color of the photo. As mentioned this is not the main subject of this project. All of those abilities already 
being prepared in the initial commit.

We focus on the development of menu located up there in the layout active bar. There are two kinds of menu will be developed 
here. First is the menu set on the active bar and the second is overflow menu that usually viewed as three verrtical dots in 
the active bar.

This project is forked from the Treehouse original [Github Project](https://github.com/treehouse/Colorizer).
